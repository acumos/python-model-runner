      "message": "I removed forwarding because it was an overly-complex feature that seemed to be trying to compensate for a lack of Acumos runtime. IMO the same functionality can be achieved more generally in a sidecar microservice that interacts with a broker or another downstream node on behalf of the model runner. The added benefit is that a single forwarder implementation can be reused for any model runner implementation that conforms to the (simpler) API. This was discussed in the new model runner API proposal doc.",
